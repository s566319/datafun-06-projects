# In this module, you'll complete a guided exploratory data analysis project, then conduct a second, unique data analysis/exploration project. the goal is to tell an unique and compelling story with data. Not just your analytical compatibilities, but your ability to communicate in a professional and engaging manner is key. 
I have created a unique project on all the sites to visit while in Latvia.
